            <br>
            <br>
             FIRST WE ARE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF GARBAGE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING !! 
             <br>
             <br>
             THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF GARBAGE :
             <br>
             <br>
             1. LAND GARBAGE 
             <br>
             <br>
             2. WATER/SEA GARBAGE 
             <br>
             <br>
             3. GAS GARBAGE

        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="infoland">land pollution, the deposition of solid or liquid waste materials on land or underground
            <br>
            <br>
             in a manner that can contaminate the soil and groundwater, threaten public health, and cause unsightly conditions and nuisances.
            <br>
            <br>
            The waste materials that cause land pollution are broadly classified as municipal solid waste (MSW, also called municipal refuse),
            <br>
            <br>
             construction and demolition (C&D) waste or debris, and hazardous waste. MSW includes nonhazardous garbage, rubbish, and trash from homes,
             <br>
            <br>
              institutions (e.g., schools), commercial establishments, and industrial facilities. Garbage contains moist and decomposable (biodegradable)
              <br>

<h1>2. WATER/SEA GARBAGE</h1>
<br>
<br>
<img id="img2" src="Industrial-Waste-Water.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<p class="infoland">
    Despite environmental regulations that protect the quality of streams, lakes, and wetlands, solid waste in the form of trash, litter, and garbage often ends up in these
    <br>
    <br>
    surface waters. Because surface waters collect in low-lying areas, anything that is dropped or blown into a watershed can eventually reach a drainageway. In urban
    <br>
    <br>
    areas, trash and litter (general terms for dry solid waste) often are transported by stormwater runoff. In both urban and rural areas, these items sometimes are
    <br>
    <br>
    illegally dumped directly into a waterbody or wetland, or deposited along riverbanks or lakeshores. Trash also comes from people who fish or participate in other
    <br>
    <br>
    forms of water-related recreation. Regardless of source or type, trash is a form of water pollution .

                <br>
                <br>
                such as manufacturing, processing, material consumption or biological processes.

                <br>
                Gaseous waste that is held in a closed container falls into the category of solid waste for disposal purposes.

                <br>
                <br>
                In India, the processes differ according to the source of solid waste. They can be classified as:
<br>
<br>
                ⦁ Municipal Solid Waste.
                <br>
                ⦁ Hazardous Solid Waste.
                <br>
                Municipal solid waste can further be divided into biodegradable, recyclable and hazardous domestic wastes.</p>

<p class="btn btn-info" id="uff">Filters built by fabrics are the simplest method to separate particles from the gas.
    <br>.
    About 99 percent of matters are filtered out when their sizes are of the order of 0.01 micrometer.
    <br>
    (1 mm = 106 m). In this method the waste gas is allowed to pass through a filter bag and the particles are collected on the inside
     are repeatedly removed.
    <br>
    Fabric filters are very good for both high and low concentration of small particles but these method is only suitable
    <br>
    for dry and free flowing particles.</p>
